(* We did the isDigit() function, reverse() function, and also figured out how the main function takes in a text file as an input using TextIO structure together.
		the pow() function was done by Jennifer and the sum() function was done by Sadiat. *)

(* isDigit() function takes in an input as a character and checks if it is an integer. if it is, it returns true else false. *)
fun isDigit(c) =
	if ord(c) >= 48 andalso ord(c) <= 57 then true else false;

    (* recursive function that reads one character at a time. It then checks if it is a digit, then convert the character option into an integer and 
    put them into an integer list. If the character option is not an integer, then turn those values into the number 23 as a placeholder and add them to the integer list. *)
