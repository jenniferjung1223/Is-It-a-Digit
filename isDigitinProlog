/* Look at the file that is given, then get a single character. Check if it is a digit, if it is, it converts it into an integer and then writes it into a file called "test2.txt'
then keeps reading the characters. If it is not a digit,then replace the character with 0. as a placeholder, and writes into 'test2.txt', and keeps reading the characters. 
Then add up all the values in the file 'test2.txt' and divide by 10 (because of the placeholder 0.) to get the original value. */
